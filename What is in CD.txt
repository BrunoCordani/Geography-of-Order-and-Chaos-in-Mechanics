                    *       What is in CD?        *
                    *******************************

Let us look through the CD and see how to use files and programs.

****************** 1) PhSpGeo.zip *********************************************

This zipped file is the most important of the CD, since it contains the five
MATLAB programs POINCARE, HAMILTON, LAGRANGE, KEPLER and LAPLACE.

Copy the zipped file on your hard disk, unzip and put the whole folder
PhSpGeo where you wish but preserving the tree structure of the
files. Start MATLAB, navigate to the folder e.g. KEPLER/Master and type <Kepler>
in the MATLAB editor: the relative Graphical User Interface will open; for the
other four programs act similarly. See the book for the snapshots of
the Graphical User Interfaces of the five programs.

The code of the programs is written under Windows XP and Windows 7 but has
been tested also in some distributions of Linux, where nevertheless the fonts
of the Graphical User Interfaces appear sometimes out of proportion: try to
fix the problem adjusting the numerical value of font_def in the
2nd row of the ColorFont.m file.

For some esoteric reason, a few labels of the graphical user interface appear incorrectly placed
with certain versions of MATLAB. To fix the problem, close and open again the program without
closing MATLAB.

The code of the three ODE solver "IRK_Gauss", "Dop853" and
"Odex" is not MATLAB native but requires a
compilation. We provide the compiled files which should run under Windows32
and some distributions of Linux (both 32 and 64 bit), but in case you can
recompile the source code in AddedODEsolver/bin/Source.

Bear in mind that, in the usually very demanding computations of the FMI, the
user can exploit a multicore machine. Indeed KEPLER, along with the other four
supplied programs, is able to parallelize the computations in the following
way. If you possess an n-core machine, in the folder Kepler and
beside the subfolder Master create n-1 subfolders Slave1, Slave2}, . . . ,
then copy the whole program KEPLER identically in
every folder: the n folders must differ only for the name. Start MATLAB then
KEPLER from the Master folder, set the parameters and click on
"File/Save setting now". Without closing, start a new instance of MATLAB, then KEPLER from a folder
SlaveX: you will notice that all the buttons of the computations are
disabled while the new button "Start Slave" appears.
Click on this button and KEPLER will wait for the start of the
master. Redo for every slave, lastly go back to the master and click on
"Calculate . . .". The whole work will be
automatically shared among the n cores. The final result is displayed by the master.

Alternatively, in Windows you can create n shortcuts on the desktop, one for
the Master and the others for the Slaves. In the Portraits folder are
available the corresponding icons, in colour and in a gray scale for Master
and Slaves, respectively. In the "Target" field of "Property" you will type
something like:
             <C:\MATLAB\bin\matlab.exe /r Kepler>
and in the "Start in" field you will type the path of the work folder, for example
      <C:\PhSpGeo\KEPLER\Master> or <C:\PhSpGeo\KEPLER\Slave1>,
adjusting clearly the paths.

************************* 2) Visualize\_3D.zip ********************************

This zipped file contains the MATLAB program sliceomatic  by Eric Ludlam
which allows to visualize sets of 3-dimensional data. We provide three
examples, regarding the resonance distribution in the action space of the
SQZcrossed system of figure 8.11.

Copy the zipped file on your hard disk, unzip and put the whole folder
Visualize\_3D where you wish. Then start MATLAB, navigate to this
folder and type <Visualize_3D>
in the MATLAB editor: you will be prompted to load data for 3D visualization.
Enter the SQZcrossed folder and one of the three subfolder
LGG3_Total}, LGG3_Detail}, LSD_Total}, then double
click on Volume.mat: the Graphical User Interface of
sliceomatic will open and you can begin the
exploration by clicking on the slice controllers, then moving the relative arrows.

************************** 3) Matlab figures **********************************

In the Matlab figures folder the reader may find some pictures in the
MATLAB format *.fig. Many of them are the original ones reported in the book,
as attested by the name itself; others are unpublished and concerns some
details. In general they regard FMI computations which require very
long times of the order of many days or weeks, even with a multicore machine,
and may serve as a base to the reader for further explorations. In
particular, with the "Mouse track" tool in the "Figure" menu one can record the values
of the coordinate of some points in the picture and use them for the
computation of the relative orbit, to which a frequency analysis can be applied.

*************************** 4) Euler.mw ***************************************

The program EULER, written in MAPLE language, calculates analytically,
thus exactly, the motion of a point under the gravitational force of
two fixed points. The exact integration is useful for
a comparison with the numerical integration of KEPLER in order to verify its accuracy.

*************************** 5) Portraits **************************************

The folder contains the portraits of the great mathematicians mentioned in the
titles of the programs and the respective icons, both in colour and in gray scale.
